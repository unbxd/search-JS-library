# v2.1.2 - Product Virtualization

- **Release Date**: 30th Oct, 2023
- **Core SDK Version**: v0.5.3
- **CDN Link**: [https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.1.2/vanillaSearch.min.js](https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.1.2/vanillaSearch.min.js)

## üöÄ Features
{: .no_toc}
- In this release, we are excited to introduce a powerful enhancement to our e-commerce product listing environment ‚Äî Product Virtualization. This feature is designed to revolutionize the way products are displayed on webpages, offering improved performance and a more responsive user experience. Please click [here](configurations/PaginationConfig.md#virtualization) to know more about virtualization.
- Within this virtualization system, there is a parameter called `bufferPages`, represented as an integer. When set to 1, the SDK employs prefetching, ensuring that one page of products is maintained ahead and behind the currently displayed page. Please click [here](configurations/PaginationConfig.md#bufferpages) to know more about bufferPages.
- Introducing Debug Mode for enhanced integration and debugging. This captures configuration and coding errors in real-time, aiding developers during integration. Please click [here](configurations/MiscellaneousConfig.md#debugmode) to know more about debugmode.


## üêõ Bug Fixes
{: .no_toc}
- Resolved issue causing random product loading and duplication during infinite scroll, ensuring correct product order and improving user experience.
- Fix in reading facet value with special characters as multi value separators. When the facet's multiValueSeparator is configured with some special characters like "|" and copy paste the URL from browser to any notes or social media, the "|" used to get encoded to "%7c". When these links are clicked from these social media sites, it used to navigate to the URL with "%7c" in it and SDK failed to recognize the same.


## üß∞ Maintenance
{: .no_toc}
- Added ESLint for comprehensive code analysis. This enforces coding style rules, identifies potential bugs, and improves code readability.
- Fix in github actions to run on release tag.

Please click [here](configurations/MiscellaneousConfig) for the more details on the extra params.

# v2.1.1 - Dynamic Extra Params

- **Release Date**: 25th Oct, 2023
- **Core SDK Version**: v0.5.1
- **CDN Link**: [https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.1.1/vanillaSearch.min.js](https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.1.1/vanillaSearch.min.js)

## üöÄ Features
{: .no_toc}
- In this release, we've enhanced the `extraParams` object used in our config. Previously, this object allowed you to send static key-value pairs to the Unbxd search API. However, we've now introduced the ability to use functions as values. This means that you can dynamically generate and send values to the API with each request. For example, you can now send different segmentation details, currencies, or languages in the request, ensuring that your API interactions are more adaptable and responsive to the specific context and requirements of your application. 

Please click [here](configurations/MiscellaneousConfig) for the more details on the extra params.

# v2.0.38

- **Release Date**: 6th June, 2023
- **Core SDK Version**: v0.4.34
- **CDN Link**: [https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.0.38/vanillaSearch.min.js](https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.0.38/vanillaSearch.min.js)

## üß∞ Maintenance
{: .no_toc}
- **Rewriting Infinite Scroll Pagination**: The infinite scroll rewrite includes pre-loading and post-loading of content based on the user's scrolling behavior. It utilizes a separate thread and the Intersection Observer API to observe changes in element intersections, improving performance and providing a smoother scrolling experience. The page number updates dynamically as the user scrolls, and the same set of products is loaded when the page is refreshed. The implementation eliminates delays caused by executing logic within the scroll event and removes dependencies on the user's scroll position, the number of products shown in a row, and the height of the product container. Only the new products are rendered, enhancing rendering performance.
- **Rewriting Click & Scroll Pagination**: The re-write of click and scroll pagination allows users to trigger the fetching of successive pages through clicking or scrolling. The implementation dynamically updates the page and loads only the necessary products, eliminating dependencies on scroll position, product display, and container height. Rendering is optimized by appending or prepending new changes instead of replacing the entire content.
- Separating out the `renderProducts` code to maintain consistency across all the render feature logics.

## üöÄ Features
{: .no_toc}
- **Introducing Page and Count in URL**: A modification has been made to the URL variables used for pagination. Instead of using "rows" and "start" to determine the number of products displayed and the starting index, respectively, the variables "page" and "count" have been introduced. The boolean variable "usePageCount" under the `pagination` config object determines whether to use this new approach (when set to true) or continue using "start" and "rows" (when set to false).

## üêõ Bug Fixes
{: .no_toc}
- Added `uc_param`, `count` and `page` in the `unbxdKeys` list.
- Fixing CSS issues in the demo template.
- Only the newly fetched products are rendered instead of re-creating and re-rendering all the products on every API call, enhancing the rendering performance.
