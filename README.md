## Getting started

### Inlcude the Library

The library can be included in 2 ways


#### ES6

Install `@unbxd-ui/vanilla-search-library` using npm.

```shell

npm install @unbxd-ui/vanilla-search-library --save

```

then, import the `UnbxdSearch` constructor in your project

```js

import  UnbxdSearch  from  "@unbxd-ui/vanilla-search-library";

```

To get our default theme, you can include the CSS in below 2 ways:

```shell

import "@unbxd-ui/vanilla-search-library/public/dist/css/vanillaSearch.css";

```

or if you are using SCSS, include the SCSS file directly

```shell

import "@unbxd-ui/vanilla-search-library/styles/index.scss";

```

#### ES5

You can also use a global-friendly UMD build:

```html

<script  src="https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.0.3/vanillaSearch.min.js"  type="text/javascript"></script>

```

This will set the `UnbxdSearch` constructor or class on the window object. 

And to get our default theme, include the CSS as shown below.

```html

<link  href="https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v2.0.3/vanillaSearch.min.css"  rel="stylesheet"></script>

```

Now you are ready to start using the library.

### Invoke with configs

Invoke the `UnbxdSearch` constructor with the desired configs.

You can find a sample invocation below:

```shell
const unbxdSearch = new UnbxdSearch({
    siteKey: "<your Site Key>",
    apiKey: "<your API key>",
    searchBoxEl: document.getElementById("unbxdInput"),
    searchButtonEl: document.getElementById("searchBtn"),
    products: {
        el: document.getElementById("searchResultsWrapper"),
        attributesMap: {
            "unxTitle": "title",
            "unxImageUrl": "imageUrl"
            "unxPrice": "displaySalePrice"
        },
        productAttributes: [
            "title",
            "imageUrl",
            "price"
        ]
    },
    noResults: {
        template:function(query){return `<div class="UNX-no-results"> No Results found ${query} </div>`}
    },
    facet: {
        facetsEl: document.getElementById("facetsWrapper"),
        selectedFacetsEl: document.getElementById("selectedFacetWrapper"),
    },
    pagination: {
        type: "FIXED_PAGINATION",
        el: document.querySelector("#clickScrollContainer"),
    },
    sort: {
        el: document.getElementById("sortWrapper"),
        options: [{
                value: "sortPrice desc",
                text: "Price High to Low"
            },
            {
                value: "sortPrice asc",
                text: " Price Low to High"
            }
        ]
    }
});

```

## Tips & Tricks

- If you are including our Search JS Library, [Autosuggest Library](https://unbxd.com/docs/site-search/integration-documentation/autosuggest-sdk/) & [Analytics Library](https://unbxd.com/docs/site-search/integration-documentation/browser-integration/) in your HTML page, the order of the files are important. 
Include the Search JS Library, followed by Autosuggest Library and then the Analytics JS Library. This should be followed by the code to invoke the library.
- Always ensure you are invoking the library (i.e. calling the UnbxdSearch constructor) after you have included the library either via URL or via npm
- Include the CSS inside the <head> tag of your HTML page & the scripts at the end of the body tag. This will ensure that the page rendering is not blocked by the javascript files.
