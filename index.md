# About the SDK

The 'Search-JS-library' is a software development kit (SDK) provided by Unbxd, that allows e-commerce websites to easily integrate Unbxd's search and product discovery functionality. The SDK is built on Vanilla JavaScript and provides an easy-to-use JavaScript API that can be used to configure, initiate and customize search requests.

This SDK does not have any dependencies on any other JavaScript frameworks or libraries, which makes it lightweight and easy to integrate into an e-commerce website. It can be easily added to the website by including a script tag on the page where it is needed, and it can be customized and extended using JavaScript methods and callbacks.


Here are a few ways the Unbxd SDK can help:

* **Improved search functionality**: Unbxd's SDK can provide advanced search capabilities such as auto-suggest, spelling correction, and synonym handling, which can result in a better search experience for your customers.

* **Enhanced product discovery**: The SDK can also provide features such as personalized product recommendations, category landing pages, and product lists that are tailored to each customer's unique preferences and behavior, leading to increased engagement and conversions.

* **Increased site performance**: Unbxd's SDK is optimized for fast search and product discovery, and it integrates with your e-commerce site's backend to reduce latency and improve the overall performance of your site.

* **Customization and flexibility**: Unbxd's SDK offers several customization options and integrations, making it easy to tailor the search and product discovery experience to your specific needs and requirements. The nomenclature and the elements present on the e-commerce page may vary across different website, but the Unbxd Javascript Search SDK can be integrated in any e-commerce website.

These functionalities are designed to improve the user experience on the e-commerce website by providing a powerful search experience, increasing the relevance of search results and providing a more personalized shopping experience for users.

It is important to note that in order to use the Unbxd Vanilla JS SDK, the e-commerce website needs to have an account with Unbxd, and must have the necessary Site and API keys to properly configure the SDK and connect it to the Unbxd platform.

Please refer to [this documentation here](https://unbxd.com/docs/site-search/integration-documentation/jssdk-documentation/) for the versions of integrations. Since we are gradually migrating all our customers toward our new upgraded SDKs, we would slowly **deprecate** the older version.
